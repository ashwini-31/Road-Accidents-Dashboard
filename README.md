# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road accident data across various dimensions such as accident severity, road surface conditions, weather, time of day, and contributing factors. The goal is to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights to improve road safety.

 Project Workflow
 
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Performed using Power Query; irrelevant columns removed and data types formatted.

Data Modeling: Implemented a star schema with a central fact table and supporting dimension tables.

DAX Measures: Created key KPIs including:

Total Accidents

High Severity Accidents

Total Casualties

Total Vehicles Involved

Dashboard Layout:

Vertical slicers for easy filtering

KPI cards on top for quick stats

Middle section with bar, donut, and column charts

Bottom visuals include heatmaps and condition-based matrices

 Key Insights
 
Most accidents occur during peak hours.

Adverse weather and slippery surfaces increase severity.

Accidents at uncontrolled junctions show higher fatality rates.

Urban regions report more frequent incidents; rural ones report more severe outcomes.
